Your advertising budget can go a long way by advertising for free on other sites. While you can find numerous options online like Craigslist, you’ll want to make sure you post on alternatives for the widest reach. We curated a list of the most popular free online advertising sites to help get you started.

Here are the top 25 free advertising sites the pros use for 2019:

<hr />

<h3><a href="https://www.gumtree.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1. Gumtree</a></h3>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3161" src="http://www.hss5.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-609-3.png" width="1280" height="603" alt="Gumtree - Free Advertising Sites" />

Gumtree started out as a U.K.-based website but is now gaining ground and serving more locations throughout Europe, Australia, and the United States. Dubbed as the European version of Craigslist, the site offers free and paid ad services for almost all categories you can think of.

<hr />

<h3><a href="https://www.classifiedads.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2. Classified Ads</a></h3>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3163" src="http://www.hss5.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-610-3.png" width="1280" height="600" alt="Classified Ads - Free Advertising Sites" />

Classified Ads is a free site that’s very straightforward, with well-defined categories and a useful search bar. And because it’s simple and easy to use, the site is very active, which means more visibility for your ad. You can choose to post an ad first and fill out your account details later on. You can also add an HTML listing that links back to your website.

<hr />

<h3><a href="http://letgo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3. LetGo</a></h3>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3165" src="http://www.hss5.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-611-3.png" width="1280" height="604" alt="Let Go - Free Advertising Sites" />

Founded in 2006 and based out of New York, LetGo allows you to create classified ads for free as well as participate in forums available for different categories. The site lets you add images and videos while also giving you the freedom to share your listings on social media.

<hr />

<h3><a href="https://www.oodle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">4. Oodle</a></h3>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3167" src="http://www.hss5.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-612-3.png" width="1072" height="637" alt="Oodle - Free Advertising Sites" />

One of the good things about Oodle is its compatibility with social media websites. You can link your Oodle account to your Facebook page to instantly update your status whenever you have new ads for items or services. The website’s look is simple and very clean, and it doesn’t look cluttered. This makes Oodle very easy to navigate and easy to use.

<hr />

<h3><a href="https://www.adpost.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5. Adpost</a></h3>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3169" src="http://www.hss5.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-613-3.png" width="1280" height="603" alt="Adpost - Free Advertising Sites" />

Adpost is another free advertising site very much like Craigslist, only with a more global reach. This is perfect if you want your ads to reach a wider audience for your listings or build an international network. While the platform can do with a little upgrading, the simplicity makes it easier even for readers with the most basic knowledge of the internet.

<hr />

<h3><a href="https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">6. Facebook Marketplace</a></h3>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3171" src="http://www.hss5.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-614-3.png" width="1280" height="602" alt="Facebook Marketplace - Free Advertising Sites" />

There’s no denying the power of Facebook when it comes to networking. Having a large marketplace to host your ads guarantees a high potential of reaching your target market. Facebook recognizes this opportunity and has constantly been upgrading their platform for a more integrated buying and selling experience. It’s important to know how to maximize Facebook features to improve your marketing, including automated chat boxes that help you handle customer service more efficiently.

<hr />

<h3><a href="http://www.ebayclassifiedsgroup.com/mobile-close5.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">7. Close5</a></h3>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3173" src="http://www.hss5.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-615-3.png" width="744" height="628" alt="Close5 App - Free Advertising Sites" />

Close5 is a mobile platform that allows sellers to manage their products with their mobile device. This was created in answer to the increasing use of mobile devices among consumers to search for services and purchase items online. Transactions can be updated and completed on the go with the usual securities and features, including chat as well as the ability to utilize hyper-local capabilities to filter deals to only those within a buyer’s area.

<hr />

<h3><a href="https://www.findermaster.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">8. Finder Master</a></h3>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3175" src="http://www.hss5.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/word-image-616-3.png" width="1280" height="603" alt="Finder Master - Free Advertising Sites" />

FinderMaster is an effective advertising platform for sellers thanks to its modern but still easy-to-navigate website, and the option to post your first ad the same time you register a new account.

Hoobly is also a lot like Craigslist but with more security features. For one, this website requires registration via email instead of waiting until right before publishing an ad to ask for email verification. This helps to prevent accounts being linked to temporary addresses, which then reduces the risk of spam or potential fraud. It is free to post an ad, and Hoobly offers a wide variety of categories that are available for browsing even before registering for an account.

<hr />

<h3><a href="https://www.locanto.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10. Locanto</a></h3>
