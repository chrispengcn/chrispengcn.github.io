<blockquote>How to Stop Clutter From Entering the Home</blockquote> <p>怎么样阻止杂物进入家中 <blockquote>The best way to beat clutter is to not let it come into your home in the first place. Clutter happens when items are not in the proper places, which is typically caused by having too many items in the house, such that organization becomes a major task. If organizing and house cleaning is becoming a burden because of the mess in your home--it's time to stop clutter at the door. Here's how.</blockquote> <p>对付杂物的最好办法就是最开始就不让杂物进入你家。当物品没有放在正确的地方的时候，它就成了杂物，尤其是房间里有类别太多的物品时，收拾、组织、分类成了一份巨大的工程。如果你的房间因为这样的杂乱而使清洁工作成为一种负担的时候---这时，你需要阻止这些杂物进入你的大门了。现在开始。 <blockquote>Instructions</blockquote> <p>建议 <blockquote>Things You'll Need:</blockquote> <p>你所需要的东西 <blockquote>Recyclable shopping bags</blockquote> <p>可以循环利用的购物袋 <blockquote>1</blockquote> <p>&nbsp; <blockquote>Shop with a purpose. Never go out shopping without a list. And stick to the list. If an item looks very tempting and affordable, ask yourself these questions: "Do I really need this?" "How often will I use it?" "Where will I put it?" "Do I not already have one like it that still works?" Your answers will tell you if you're about to bring another piece of clutter into your home.</blockquote> <p>有目的的去购物。永远不要出去购物的时候不带明细表。并且要严格遵守明细表。如果遇到某个非常诱人的物品并且还能支付得起，要问自己以下问题：“我真的需要它吗？”“我会经常用它吗？”“我将把它放在哪里呢？”“我是不是有个跟它差不多但是仍旧能够使用的呢？”你的回答将会告诉你你是否需要将另外一个杂物带回家。 <blockquote>2</blockquote> <p>&nbsp; <blockquote>Don't be tempted by bargains. Discounts and "good buy" items are the primary candidates for clutter. Don't buy another pair of table lamps just because it's on sale. A discount item may be half off, but if it ends up among the unused gadgets in your kitchen cabinet; that's still money you spent on clutter instead of basic necessities.</blockquote> <p>不要被特价物品所诱惑。打折和好买的物品往往大多都是杂物的候选品。不要因为打折而去购买另外一台台灯。也许打折的物品时半价的，但是如果最后它的结果只是闲置在你的厨柜里，那你仍旧是将钱花在杂物上而不是花在基本所需上。 <blockquote>3</blockquote> <p>&nbsp; <blockquote>Cancel subscriptions that you don't read. Magazines and other periodicals will be delivered to your door like clockwork, whether you read them or not. If certain publications you're subscribed to remain unread and are simply cluttering up the coffee table, it's time to cancel.</blockquote> <p>取消订阅的那些你并不读的刊物。无论你是读还是不读，杂志和一些期刊会像时钟一样准时的送到你家门口。如果你订阅的那些刊物你仍旧是不会读或者只是简单的扔在咖啡桌上，那是时候你去取消这些订阅了。 <blockquote>4</blockquote> <p>&nbsp; <blockquote>Use recyclable shopping bags. Plastic and paper shopping bags are great at causing clutter in the kitchen. Keep them out by using recyclable and washable shopping bags.</blockquote> <p>使用可回收利用的购物袋。塑料袋和纸袋是导致厨房杂物的最大原因。通过使用可回收利用和可清洗的购物袋来阻止塑料袋和纸袋的进入。 <blockquote>5</blockquote> <p>&nbsp; <blockquote>Consider renting or borrowing instead of buying. Some yard equipment and home improvement tools get used only once or once in a while. Instead of buying something that will simply add to the clutter in your garage for most of the year, look into renting or borrowing from a friend.</blockquote> <p>试着用租和借的方式来代替买。一些院子里的和改善住宅的工具往往只用一次或是一小段时间。用买的方式只会增加你车库里的杂物，试着从你朋友那租或是借。 <blockquote>Tips &amp; Warnings</blockquote> <p>提示和警告 <blockquote> <p>Neighborhood (estate, yard, garage) sales are excellent sources of clutter. Even if items are selling for less than a dollar each, always evaluate whether you're acquiring something that will only add to the clutter in your home. <p>Borrow party serving accessories and paraphernalia from family and friends instead of buying your own rarely-used sets.</p></blockquote> <p>在这里输入译文街坊里的售卖往往是杂物的一个非常好的来源。即使这项物品的所卖的价钱低于1美金，经常性的评估一下你所需要添加的东西是否只会增加你家里的杂物。 <p>从别的家庭或是朋友那借聚会上需要用的物品，而不是买那些你几乎从来都不用的物品。</p>
