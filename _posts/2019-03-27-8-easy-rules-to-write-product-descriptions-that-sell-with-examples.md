The customer is now on your page, looking for the perfect product that fits his/her need.

The very last step is convincing the customer to click the “add to cart” button.

How?

With an effective <a href="https://www.referralcandy.com/blog/product-pages/">product description</a>.

Which means – the product description is one of the most important aspects of your online shop when it comes to conversion.

But…
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Even though it holds incredible power, good product copy can be hard to write.</span></p>
<p class="c2">It can be especially mind-numbing when you have a long list of items on your product page to work through.</p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">We’ve broken it down into 8 easy-to-follow rules about product description writing that will help you create product <a href="https://www.referralcandy.com/blog/referral-program-copy/">copy that sells</a>.</span></p>

<h2 id="h.jprrrmusgcse" class="c7"><span class="c6">1. Know Who Your Target Audience is</span></h2>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">The first step to writing product descriptions is to define your target audience.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">You want to be able to define which features would be of most interest to your potential buyers.</span></p>
<p class="c2">This begins with understanding your <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/buyer-persona-research"><span class="c5">buyer persona</span></a>, a break down of the characteristics of your potential customers. Your buyer persona will help you understand which features will be most valuable to your customers.</p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">As you are writing your product description, keep these questions in mind:</span></p>

<ul class="c8 lst-kix_79ocp3gr1b6h-0 start">
 	<li class="c2 c3"><span class="c0">How did this person arrive to your page?</span></li>
 	<li class="c2 c3"><span class="c0">What are his or her interests, generally?</span></li>
 	<li class="c2 c3"><span class="c0">Why would this person be interested in your Shopify store, specifically?</span></li>
 	<li class="c2 c3"><span class="c0">How would this person describe the product to a friend?</span></li>
 	<li class="c2 c3"><span class="c0">What features or benefits would interest this person the most?</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="c2">By keeping these questions in mind as you write your product copy, you will be <span class="c0">better able to write a product description that sells.</span></p>
<p class="c2">For example, take a look at this product by <span class="c5"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.thesaltlady.com/shop/light-colored-himalayan-salt-lamp/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1525664857085000">The Salt Lady</a></span><span class="c0">.</span></p>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2648" src="http://hss5.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/how-to-write-a-good-product-description-for-ecommerce-seo-salt-lady-lamp-example-600x625.png" alt="how to write a good product description for ecommerce seo - salt lady lamp example" width="600" height="625" />
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">The buyer persona is not just any person who is shopping for a lamp.</span></p>
<p class="c2">Instead, the buyer persona is likely interested in all-natural remedies for the home, especially when it comes to allergies. In this case, the potential buyer would likely be interested in learning about these remedies in the product description.</p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rather than focus on the decorative features of the lamp, like most other product descriptions for lamps, The Salt Lady focuses on the features that would appeal to her buyer persona the most.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">This leads perfectly into rule #2 for writing product descriptions.</span></p>

<h2 id="h.4uxq18h4ursh" class="c7"><span class="c6">2. Focus on the Product Benefits</span></h2>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">As a business owner, you are understandably excited to share all of the qualities of your products. You want to show that your product has the best features and most unique specs.</span></p>
<p class="c2">The buyer, however, is not necessarily interested in the mundane features of the product. Instead, they want to know how it can benefit them.</p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">A product feature is a factual statement about the product that provides technical information. A product benefit, on the other hand, tells <strong>how the product can improve the buyer’s life</strong>.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">If we take a closer look at the product description of the very unique item from above, we can see the key features of the product as well as the benefits.</span></p>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2649" src="http://hss5.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/how-to-write-a-good-product-description-for-ecommerce-seo-product-description-improve-buyers-life-600x294.png" alt="how to write a good product description for ecommerce seo - product description improve buyer's life" width="600" height="294" />
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">In this product description, the product features include 100% pure Himalayan salt, a weight of 4-6 lbs., and an on/off cord and light bulb set.</span></p>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2650" src="http://hss5.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/how-to-write-a-good-product-description-that-sell-product-benefits-600x294.png" alt="how to write a good product description that sell - product benefits" width="600" height="294" />
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">The product benefits include reduced EMF pollution, purified air, and reduced symptoms of allergies, asthma, and headaches.</span></p>
<p class="c2">Another example can be found in the product description at <a href="https://www.yankeecandle.com/product/a-calm--quiet-place/_/R-1577150"><span class="c5">The Yankee Candle Company</span></a> for their sample-size votive candle.</p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">So what makes this candle so special? Well, the answer lies in the direct benefits that it will bring to the buyer.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2651" src="http://hss5.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/how-to-write-a-good-product-description-that-sells-direct-buyer-benefits-600x318.png" alt="how to write a good product description that sells - direct buyer benefits" width="600" height="318" /></p>
<p class="c2">They clearly outline the benefits of owning this tiny candle, most of which center around convenience. Rather than pushing the generic scent or even the <span class="c0">role of a candle in the home, they are highlighting the benefit of having this particular sample size candle.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">The main benefits that customers can expect from this candle are:</span></p>

<ul class="c8 lst-kix_r7472hc5ujgb-0 start">
 	<li class="c2 c3"><span class="c0">You can sample this scent without investing in a bigger, more expensive candle.</span></li>
 	<li class="c2 c3"><span class="c0">It is the perfect size for small moments throughout the day.</span></li>
 	<li class="c2 c3"><span class="c0">It is a great addition to a bigger focal point, such as a centerpiece at dinner parties.</span></li>
 	<li class="c2 c3">It is safe and easy to use. You can essentially light the candle and walk away.</li>
</ul>
<p class="c2">The content of your product description should convince the potential buyers that it will improve their lives in obvious, measurable ways<span class="c0">.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Before you begin writing your product descriptions, make an outline of the features and benefits of your product. Think about how the product either increases pleasure or reduces a pain point.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">For every feature that you list, figure out how this will directly benefit the buyer.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">If the feature is 100% Himalayan salt, then the benefit is reduced allergies.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">If the feature is a 1.75 ounce candle, the benefit is that it can be used in small spaces, such as a nightstand, a bathroom, or an end table.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Translating features into benefits like this will help you write more persuasive product descriptions and more quickly.</span></p>

<h2 id="h.81zv40kknoyc" class="c7"><span class="c6">3. Tell the Full Story</span></h2>
<p class="c2">A good product description should give all relevant details, convince the buyer of its benefits, and pack an emotional punch<span class="c0">.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><a href="https://www.impactbnd.com/blog/emotion-influence-buying-behavior"><span class="c5">Emotions influence buyer behavior</span></a><span class="c0">, so your product description is the perfect place to elicit emotions.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">How do you do this?</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">By filling in any gaps that potential buyers may have about the product.</span></p>
<p class="c2">Sivana Spirit does an excellent job of this in their product description for their <span class="c5"><a href="https://www.sivanaspirit.com/collections/women-rings/products/natural-amethyst-ring">Natural Amethyst Ring</a>.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2652" src="http://hss5.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/how-to-write-a-good-product-description-that-sells-features-and-key-storytelling-referralcandy.png" alt="how to write a good product description that sells - features and key storytelling referralcandy" width="423" height="424" /></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">The product description includes features, sure, but it goes further into the story of the key feature: the amethyst.</span></p>
<p class="c2">It does this by focusing on the traditional spiritual benefits of amethyst. It focuses especially on the ways in which it can be used, making it easy for the customer to imagine having this ring in his or her life.</p>
<p class="c2">Another example of storytelling in the product description can be found at <a href="http://www.teemateas.com/your-teas/immortality"><span class="c5">Teema Teas</span></a><span class="c0">.</span></p>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2653" src="http://hss5.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/how-to-write-a-good-product-description-that-sells-teema-teas-product-storytelling-600x658.png" alt="how to write a good product description that sells - teema teas product storytelling" width="600" height="658" />
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">In the product description for the “Immortality Tea”, we learn about the historical significance of this type of tea as well as its many benefits.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">By including the story about its traditional uses, the reader automatically envisions the tea being carefully cultivated hundreds of years ago and shared among the people in rural China.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">It allows you to imagine a life with this tea. It kind of makes you want to have this tea in your life, as well.</span></p>
<p class="c2">By telling a mini-story about the product, you are much more likely to connect with the potential buyers on an emotional level rather than a transactional one. This is key to converting your potential buyers into actual buyers.</p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">When it comes to telling a story in your product description, try to answer these questions</span></p>

<ul class="c8 lst-kix_mqw3bzmkr0yd-0 start">
 	<li class="c2 c3"><span class="c0">Who originally made this product?</span></li>
 	<li class="c2 c3"><span class="c0">What inspired them to make this product?</span></li>
 	<li class="c2 c3"><span class="c0">What was the journey of making this product?</span></li>
 	<li class="c2 c3"><span class="c0">How would this product look in the buyer’s day-to-day life?</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Setting the scene like this will help the buyer envision this product in a way that features and specs could never do. If you can get the buyer to imagine the product as an emotional conquest or companion, then they will likely forget that they are being sold to.</span></p>

<h2 id="h.iwlgne70hsj4" class="c7">4. Use Natural Language <span class="c6">and Tone</span></h2>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">If you read your description aloud, does it sound like a real conversation that you would have with your friend?</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Or does it sound like a computer-generated string of words?</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">If your product description isn’t something that you would say to your friend about the product, then it’s time to inject a little life into them.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Bringing this natural tone–one that you would use in a real conversation–will help your customer connect with your brand.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><a href="http://www.nastygal.com/hey-sweet-thing-heel/AGG91138.html"><span class="c5">Nasty Gal</span></a><span class="c0"> does this exceptionally well, using the tone of “fun loving girlfriend” throughout the entire site, even in the product titles.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">For example, rather than selling regular high-heel shoes, they are selling sassy shoes that one young woman might recommend to another.</span></p>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2654" src="http://hss5.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/how-to-write-a-good-product-description-that-sells-nasty-gal-fun-loving-girlfriend-tone-600x420.png" alt="how to write a good product description that sells - nasty gal fun loving girlfriend tone" width="600" height="420" />
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">This girlfriend tone is carried throughout the website, from the product titles, product descriptions, color scheme, down to the very name of the company.</span></p>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2655" src="http://hss5.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/how-to-write-a-good-product-description-that-sells-nasty-gal-product-tone-title-website-600x309.png" alt="how to write a good product description that sells - nasty gal product tone title website" width="600" height="309" />
<p class="c2">Another example can be see with <a href="https://thrivemarket.com/p/mrs-meyers-dish-soap-lemon-verbena"><span class="c5">Mrs. Meyer’s</span></a><span class="c0"> all-natural dish soap.</span></p>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2656" src="http://hss5.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/how-to-write-a-good-product-description-that-sells-mrs-meyer-all-dish-soap-600x233.png" alt="how to write a good product description that sells - mrs meyer all dish soap" width="600" height="233" />
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">The product description uses natural language that you might use in a real conversation with your friend. There are no empty adjectives or sweeping claims. It’s just a helpful description of the product that highlights its benefits.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">The tone sounds natural and is in line with the general tone of the brand, overall.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Using a consistent tone that matches the brand builds trust with the customers and makes certain e-commerce brands much more memorable than the thousands of others currently selling products on Shopify.</span></p>

<h2 id="h.xd5sn5dpfj1" class="c7"><span class="c6">5. Use Power Words That Sell</span></h2>
<p class="c2">There are certain words and phrases that naturally elicit an emotional response in humans. Luckily for Shopify store owners, this also<span class="c5"> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/23/dining/23menus.html">increases sales</a></span><span class="c0">.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">By being mindful of these words and phrases, you can more easily convince your customers to take the leap and make the purchase.</span></p>
<p class="c2">Jon Morrow at Smart Blogger describes these as “<span class="c5"><a href="https://smartblogger.com/power-words/">power words</a>.</span><span class="c0">” He has an entire list of words that can help make your product copy more enticing.</span></p>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2657" src="http://hss5.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/how-to-write-a-good-product-description-that-sells-jon-morrow-smat-blogger-power-words-600x407.png" alt="how to write a good product description that sells - jon morrow smat blogger power words" width="600" height="407" />
<p class="c2"><a href="https://www.bangsshoes.com/collections/adventure/products/sahara-sand-hightop"><span class="c5">Bangs Shoes</span></a><span class="c0"> packs power words into their product description that make you forget that you’re about to drop $60 on a pair of shoes.</span></p>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2658" src="http://hss5.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/how-to-write-a-good-product-description-that-sells-bangs-shoes-power-words-.png" alt="how to write a good product description that sells - bangs shoes power words" width="340" height="646" />
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">These shoes are a “delicious” experience that will help you “rock” life, whatever that means to you. They bring “positivity” as you are out “exploring” and make your entire experience a whole lot better.</span></p>
<p class="c2">You can almost hear your best friend telling you about these shoes and that is exactly what they wanted as they were writing this product description. Because who can turn down a product that is recommended by your best friend?</p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">As you write your product descriptions, look for any descriptive words or adjectives that could use a little bit of dressing up.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rather than using words like “nice” or “high-quality”, opt for power words like “stunning” or “sensational”.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">By sprinkling these good descriptive words into your product descriptions, you are subtly convincing the buyers that your products are exciting, impressive, and worth the purchase.</span></p>

<h2 id="h.bbv182e67dkq" class="c7">6. Make it <span class="c6">Easy to Scan</span></h2>
<p class="c2">People have short attention spans and <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-users-read-on-the-web/"><span class="c5">read only about 16%</span></a><span class="c0"> of what’s on the page. So your product description needs to be able to capture that coveted 16% in an effective way.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">You can do this by making your descriptions super scannable.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">As in, the buyer is able to find exactly the information he or she wants without wasting time sifting through other pieces of information.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Make your product descriptions easy to scan by including bullet points, short paragraphs made up of just a few sentences each, lots of white space, and different size fonts.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><a href="https://www.healthwarrior.com/collections/chia-bars/products/chia-bars-apple-cinnamon-15-pack"><span class="c5">Health Warrior</span></a><span class="c0"> does a great job of making a scannable page for their chia seed bars. They include different size fonts, a short paragraph, and bullet points of the key benefits of the bar.</span></p>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2659" src="http://hss5.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/how-to-write-a-good-product-description-that-sells-health-warrior-easy-to-scan-600x170.png" alt="how to write a good product description that sells - health warrior easy to scan" width="600" height="170" />
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">As you are writing product descriptions for your Shopify store, look for easy opportunities to follow this same scannable structure.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ingredients and specs can easily be put into bullet points. The story and highlights can easily be put into a short paragraph. The product title can be put into a heading.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">By making your product description easier to read, you are less likely to lose a potential customer during the process.</span></p>

<h2 id="h.b6rccc73btqq" class="c7"><span class="c6">7. Optimize for Search Engines</span></h2>
<p class="c2">In virtually everything that you do on your Shopify store, you should be optimizing the content for search engines. <a href="https://www.referralcandy.com/blog/shopify-seo/"><span class="c5">Search engine optimization</span></a><span class="c0"> (SEO) is the easiest way to attract new customers to your page, which is the very first step in convincing a person to buy your products.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Optimization begins with keywords, which are usually the search term that buyers use to find the product that they are shopping for.</span></p>
<p class="c2">With a little bit of <a href="https://www.referralcandy.com/blog/shopify-keyword-research/"><span class="c5">keyword research</span></a><span class="c0">, you can quickly discover which keywords are best for your Shopify store.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">“Women’s black dress pants”, for example, is a keyword that could easily be optimized in your online store.</span></p>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2660" src="http://hss5.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/how-to-write-a-good-product-description-that-sells-search-engine-optimised-womens-dress-pants.png" alt="how to write a good product description that sells - search engine optimised womens dress pants" width="509" height="871" />
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">With a quick search for women’s black dress pants, you will see the top results include some variation of the keyword, such as “black dress pants for women” and “women’s casual &amp; dress pants”.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Look for the bolded words in the descriptions to get an idea of what Google currently favors.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">If we click on one of the listings on the first page, we can see how they use this keyword on their site to appear in the search results.</span></p>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2661" src="http://hss5.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/how-to-write-a-good-product-description-that-sells-featured-keyword-on-product-pages-1-600x339.png" alt="" width="600" height="339" />
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">They use the keyword, or a variation of it, both at the top of the product page, as well as in the product title.</span></p>
<p class="c2">For good measure, and in line with best SEO practices, <span class="c5"><a href="https://help.shopify.com/manual/promoting-marketing/seo/adding-keywords">Shopify</a> </span><span class="c0">recommends placing your keyword in your</span></p>

<ul class="c8 lst-kix_542lnl8rk06g-0 start">
 	<li class="c2 c3"><span class="c0">Page titles</span></li>
 	<li class="c2 c3"><span class="c0">Meta descriptions</span></li>
 	<li class="c2 c3"><span class="c0">Image tags (called ALT tags)</span></li>
 	<li class="c2 c3"><span class="c0">Product descriptions</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="c2">For a better idea of which keywords you could use for your product, run your keyword through <a href="https://lsigraph.com/"><span class="c5">LSIGraph</span></a><span class="c0"> to generate a list of related keywords. This tool crawls the internet to find which pages are ranking the highest on search engines for your selected keyword. Then it lists the most commonly used keywords on those pages.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">This will give you an idea of what is currently performing well on search engines and can be used in your product titles or product descriptions.</span></p>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2662" src="http://hss5.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/how-to-write-a-good-product-description-that-sells-lsi-keywords-related-variations-1-600x459.png" alt="how to write a good product description that sells - lsi keywords related variations" width="600" height="459" />
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">With this list of related keywords, we can see that the word “cheap” is a popular search term and could easily be used within your product title or description.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Keep in mind that it is best to have the main keyword within your product title as it carries the most weight with search engines.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Will adding the keywords to your product titles and descriptions earn you a number one ranking on the search results page?</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Probably not.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">But it will definitely help make your product easier to find for those who are actively seeking your product.</span></p>

<h2 id="h.c48vf9k7ped1" class="c7"><span class="c6">8. Use Good Images</span></h2>
<p class="c2">Even if you master product description writing, you must still have quality images<span class="c0"> to go with it.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Why?</span></p>
<p class="c2">Because <a href="http://thegallerystudios.com/6-powerful-reasons-visuals-marketing/"><span class="c5">63% of customers</span></a><span class="c0"> think that a product image is more important than the description or even the reviews.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">So an important aspect of your product description is actually in the photo itself.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Quality photos will show the customer all of the key features about your product. They will also allow the customer to imagine having this product in her life.</span></p>
<p class="c2">For example, <a href="https://www.vitamix.com/us/en_us/shop/classic-blenders"><span class="c5">Vitamix</span></a><span class="c0">, a brand that sells professional grade blenders, uses quality images and videos on their product pages to help make the sell.</span></p>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2663" src="http://hss5.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/how-to-write-a-good-product-description-that-sells-vitamix-classic-blender-use-good-images-1-600x402.png" alt="how to write a good product description that sells - vitamix classic blender use good images" width="600" height="402" />
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rather than telling you about the engine or the capacity of the blender, they show you a picture of a blender filled with food items as well as an inspiring video about the motor.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">You will also notice that they use enticing power words and list the benefits within the very short, scannable product description.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">By showing what the blender is capable of, both in technical and practical ways, the customer is able to immediately imagine having this blender at home, in real life.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c5"><a href="https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/products/details/cameras/point-and-shoot/advanced-cameras/powershot-g3-x">Canon</a> </span><span class="c0">does the same by providing both video and quality images to display the features of their PowerShot camera.</span></p>
&nbsp;
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">The features are displayed in a way that feels a bit like you are poking and prodding at the camera yourself. If you held this camera in your hands, you would likely pull at the screen, extend the lens, and use the flash as you tested it out.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">But since you cannot hold the camera in your hands, the images do all of the poking and prodding for you.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Why does this work?</span></p>
<p class="c2">Because <span class="c5"><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1345908">research</a> </span><span class="c0">shows that customers who are able to hold a product in their hands are much more likely to have the desire to own the product. The same can be said for images or videos that encourage touch.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Understandably, you may<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2664" src="http://hss5.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/how-to-write-a-good-product-description-that-sells-canon-powershot-looks-great-600x256.png" alt="how to write a good product description that sells - canon powershot looks great" width="600" height="256" />not have a professional video service to prepare something so spectacular. But you can, at the very least, be sure to provide quality photos of your product that clearly display its benefits.</span></p>

<h2 id="h.8lfffxafv871" class="c10"><span class="c11">Create (And Test) Your Own Product Description Template</span></h2>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Even with these eight rules to writing product descriptions that sell,  you may still want to use a product description template.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Unfortunately, there is no one-size-fits-all for product copy.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Instead, try to make your own description template. Take the time to consider the quality criteria that your target audience is looking for and be sure to include it in your descriptions.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">A few helpful questions to guide your writing may be</span></p>

<ul class="c8 lst-kix_umffqecjk0dt-0 start">
 	<li class="c2 c3"><span class="c0">What problem is your product solving?</span></li>
 	<li class="c2 c3"><span class="c0">Which power words have you included?</span></li>
 	<li class="c2 c3"><span class="c0">Did you include the full story?</span></li>
 	<li class="c2 c3"><span class="c0">Would you say this to a friend?</span></li>
 	<li class="c2 c3"><span class="c0">Does your image clearly display its key features and benefits?</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Once you’ve found a nice formula for your product descriptions, test them out. Implement these rules on a set of your products and monitor the results. Pay attention to whether or not it helps increase your sales or boost your organic traffic.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">If the new product descriptions indeed increase sales, then go ahead and make similar changes to the rest of your products within your Shopify store. If not, then examine your changes and look for opportunities to improve them.</span></p>

<h2 id="h.9fspzv4feodx" class="c7"><span class="c6">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">These eight rules are based on consumer research and have been proven to be effective in increasing sales. The main takeaway is that your product descriptions shouldn’t push your product so much as cut to the main points about why it will improve your customer’s life. And if you can convince your customers of that, then your sales will increase.</span></p>
